        One tiny **Hobbit** against all the evil the world could muster.
        
        A sane being would have given up, but Samwise burned with a magnificent madness, a *glowing* obsession to surmount every obstacle, to find [Frodo](http://google.com), destroy the Ring, and cleanse Middle Earth of its festering malignancy. He knew he would try again. Fail, perhaps. And try once more. A thousand, thousand times if need be, but he would not give up the quest.
